  ## Macro `Rx__Export`
  Marks symbols for export if we are building as a shared library.

  When building a shared library with certain compilers or on certain platforms,
  we have to export our symbols explicitly. We use platform or compiler specific
  macros to reliably export our symbols. On unknown systems, or if we are not
  building as shared, the macro is left blank.

/*
  ## Macro `Rx__Extern`
  Marks symbols as C to make sure C++ compilers don't choke on our code.

  When a C++ compiler tries to compile C code, it cannot recognize the code as
  such and thinks they are C++. This is a problem because C++ mangles all symbol
  names, to make its many useless and stupid features like overloading possible.
  To shield our code from such blasphemy, we use the `extern "C"` syntax to mark
  our code as C.

  We set this to `extern` if we're not on C++ so that the compiler understands
  the symbols as declared, not defined. I know that nowadays compilers can do
  all sorts of gymnastics and figure this out, but my brain just does not let me
  ignore small details like this. Case in point, I have IWYU pragmas sprinkled
  all over instead of letting it infer them.
